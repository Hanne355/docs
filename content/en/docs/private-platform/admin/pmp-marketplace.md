## 1 Introduction

In the **Marketplace** section, administrators can manage various settings related to the content available on the Private Platform Marketplace. The Private Platform Marketplace is a local version of the [Mendix Marketplace](/appstore/overview/), enclosed entirely within the Private Platform. Developers in your organization can also create their own modules, connectors, and sample apps, and share them on the Private Platform Marketplace to make them available to other users.

As the administrator, you can perform the following actions:

* In the **Content Management** tab, you can view the Marketplace content that your users have already published, as well as any items which are pending approval, or which have been rejected.
* In the **Taxonomy Management** tab, you can configure the supported Studio Pro versions and sub-categories that your users can select when creating Marketplace content. You can also view and edit the available licenses.
* In the **Content Import** tab, you can view the contents available in your Private Marketplace. You can also download and import the modules in bulk.
