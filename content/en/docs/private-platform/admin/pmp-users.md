## User Management

As the administrator, you can perform the following actions:

* In the **User Management** tab, you can create and edit accounts for your local users and API users (that is, accounts that are used by an API service to access your Private Mendix Platform). By clicking **More Options** ({{% icon name="three-dots-menu-horizontal" %}}) by an account, you can quickly perform a number of actions:

    * Edit a user's name and email
    * Assign or remove user roles
    * Block a user
    * Change a user's password
    * Configure the language and time zone settings for a user
    * Delete a user account

* In the **Group Management** tab, you can create and edit user groups. These groups typically reflect your organization's structure. You can also use the **Automation Settings** option to automatically assign users to groups based on their profile attributes.
